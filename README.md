# Chess
Making a chess game using modern C++

With this project I have learnt many things. I hope that this will allow me to build my first AI once I finish implementing
the rules.

Even with optimisation, the executable for this program is very large, currently standing at 61 KB.
However, the whole program has been implemented using 8-bit integers and 64-bit pointers, and so is very resource-light.

I am mainly hoping for speed when this is built, hopefully taking less than a second per move for the computer.
If this can be implemented well, I will try the same program in C, without the fancy modern C++ STL objects :)

I still refuse to use <algorithm>

Things I implemented for the first time in this project:

- Operator overloading
- Lambda expression (OMG!)
- Polymorphism (through virtual functions) and Inheritance (through derived classes)
- Smart Pointers
- Header Guards (how did I never notice these?)

Things I have definitely improved on:

- Pointer Mathematics (only took 4 years)
- Writing std::
- Building Classes
- Converting from int to char and v.v.
