Hi!

I am a very inexperienced user of GitHub who rarely does much contribution. However, if you have any advice, issues, enhancements, or new implementations to share with me, and you think that it won't break the code, let me know. I'll open a new branch from Master and merge into that, and I'll investigate if it breaks the program or not.

As long as everything is good, I will be very happy to accept contributors to this project.

Thanks for your help!
